learning how to make a to do list with javascript

Hi there! I'm teaching myself web development and using github to archive the projects i'm making in order to learn. As I'm a total newbie, I'm using tutoriels coming from various websites, pre-made css codes, that kind of stuff (you started somewhere too, I'm sure you know what I mean). Please don't have a heart attack looking into my code ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა And do not hesitate to give me advise, I'm in my shonen arc, where I'll train as much as possible to become the greatest developer of all time (૭ ｡•̀ ᵕ •́｡ )૭

Thanks for your understanding !
